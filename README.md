## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn or
NPM, installed in your environment.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the
  installer. Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might
  need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following
  commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the
  [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the
  [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following
command.

    $ node --version
    v14.x

    $ npm --version
    6.x

### Yarn installation

After installing node, this project will need yarn too, so just run the
following command.
